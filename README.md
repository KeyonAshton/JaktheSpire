## Current Features:

As of right now, I only have the basis of a starter relic, the green eco not quite working right, 2 attack cards, and the green eco card.
I am currently trying to learn how to actually make the things while I work on planning everything out.
I also have a thing to tell the user how many upgrades are left on each card.
* Starting relic (I only have the core of what I'll be making it into)
* Starter Strikes and Defends, modified slightly
* A starter Green Eco card.
* [Combos](CurrentFeatures/Combos.md)

## Planned Features:

Everything stated in Planned Features are subject to heavy balancing before, during, and after creation. They are "Planned" for a reason.
Almost everything is in planning for the main character, I am not touching Orange Lightning yet.

As this mod is just getting started, the planned features list is too long for just here, so I will have a basic list and a link to an explanation of each.
* Artwork, I am leaving everything as BaseMod gives it for now (other than character background), but I plan on commissioning an artist at some point 
* [Jak and Daxter as separate Characters](PlannedFeatures/Characters.md)
* [6 types of Eco](PlannedFeatures/Ecos.md)
* [Zoomers](PlannedFeatures/Zoomers.md)
* [Jet Board](PlannedFeatures/JetBoard.md)
* [4 - 8 Guns](PlannedFeatures/Guns.md)
