# Jak the Spire



---

## Current Features:

As of right now, I only have the basis of a starter relic, the green eco not quite working right, 2 attack cards, and the green eco card.
I am currently trying to learn how to actually make the things while I work on planning everything out.

## Planned Features:

Everything stated in Planned Features are subject to heavy balancing before, during, and after creation. They are "Planned" for a reason.

As this mod is just getting started, the planned features list is too long for just here, so I will have a basic list and a link to an explanation of each.
* [Jak and Daxter as separate Characters](PlannedFeatures/Characters.md)
* [6 types of Eco](PlannedFeatures/Ecos.md)
* [Zoomers](PlannedFeatures/Zoomers.md)
* [Jet Board](PlannedFeatures/JetBoard.md)
* [4 - 8 Guns](PlannedFeatures/Guns.md)
* [Potentially combos](PlannedFeatures/Combos.md)
