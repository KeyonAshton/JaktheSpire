# Zoomers

As of right now, I want 3 or 4 types of zoomers, with 2 or 3 balancing each other out and 1 based on the A-Grav Zoomer from TPL.

Basic ideas before getting to the A-Grav Zoomer:
* Can only "ride" 1 zoomer at a time, also can't ride a jet board when on a zoomer
* Give something similar to plated armor, acts as zoomer health
  * When zoomer health gets hits 0, deals a lot of damage to Jak based on the zoomer
  * The "big" zoomer has the highest health
  * The "small" zoomer has the lowest health
* When on 1, it gives a card with retain and exhaust to dismount the zoomer
* Zoomers have a small chance to evade attacks
  * The "small" zoomer has the highest chance
  * The "big" zoomer might not have any chance
* Light and Dark Eco forms can't be used
