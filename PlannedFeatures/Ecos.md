# Eco

There will be 6 types of Eco:
* Blue
* Green
* Red
* Yellow
* Dark
* Light

I also plan on having each eco in 2 types:
* Orb/cluster form, some way for repeatable gain in high bursts
  * I don't know if I only want to allow 1 eco at a time, like TPL
  * Allowing multiple at a time makes simpler coding and simpler for the player
* Vent form, a continuous gain across turns in low amounts
  * You can only be on 1 vent at a time
  * Balancing will determine if getting off a vent refunds the old vent, or if it's gone for the rest of combat

## Blue Eco

* Gives energy equal to stacks.
* Can stack up to 5 at most, maybe.
* Decreases by 1 per turn.
* Vent either caps it out, or provides 2 per turn to counter the decrease.

---

## Green Eco

* Can heal 1/16th of health.
* Takes 50 stacks.
* Stacks are transferred across battles, kept on starter relic.
* Only 1 card (starter), maybe 1 additional card can give green eco.
* Starter card has 3 upgrades:
  * Base gives 3 eco
  * First upgrade gives 5 eco
  * Second gives 50, but acts as a power to only be able to be used once per game.
  * Last turns it into a vent, providing a continuous stream of 2 per turn.

## Red Eco

* Gives temporary stacks of strength.
* Can stack up to 10 at most, maybe.
* Decreases by 1 per turn.
* Vent either caps it out, or provides 2 per turn to counter the decrease.

---

## Yellow Eco

* Can modify most attacks, mainly bypassing thorns.
* Can stack up to 5 at most, maybe.
* Decreases by 1 per turn.
* Vent either caps it out, or provides 2 per turn to counter the decrease.

## Dark Eco

* Slower buildup than Green Eco
* Might require killing monsters to add to charge
* Relic keeps track of eco amount
* Requires a card to activate Dark Jak form
* Decreases all damage by half
* Can't use guns, jet board, or zoomers
* Can't use when on a jet board or zoomer
* Puts gun away/removes gun when activated
* Has very powerful attacks, might require combos
* Stops other Eco gain
* Clears other Eco out (except amount in relic)

## Light Eco

* Slower buildup than Green Eco
* Might require killing monsters to add to charge
* Relic keeps track of eco amount
* Requires a card to activate Light Jak form
* Can't use jet board, or zoomers
* Can't use when on a jet board or zoomer
* Using guns drains Light Eco per attack
* Mostly defensive in nature
* Might be able to heal
* Stops other Eco gain
* Clears other Eco out (except amount in relic)
