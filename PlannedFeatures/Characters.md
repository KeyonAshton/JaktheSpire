# Characters

I am planning on having 2 characters: The Sidekick, and Orange Lightning.

## The Sidekick

The Sidekick is Jak, but a few of his cards will have names as if Daxter was telling him what to do.
I wanted to make a reference to the end of Jak 3 when Daxter says next adventure he calls the shots.
The name comes from Daxter calling Jak the sidekick multiple times starting from when Kor says "I am happy to say that you and your sidekick are causing quite a stir in our fight against the Baron." and Daxter replies with "You hear that, Jak? You're the sidekick!"
There's also a line from Jak 3 with one of the soldiers "This ain't no place for a rat and his boy" implying that the rat is in control, not the boy.

The Sidekick will be able to control eco, ride on zoomers, and use the jet board. He will also have access to the bigger guns.

## Orange Lightning

I don't have much planned for this class yet.

Daxter will be a lot more nimble than Jak, so I might add more defense to his deck, or chances to avoid attacks, not entirely certain.
I will either do reasearch into the Daxter game, or just play it myself, but I would like to use a lot of ideas from it for this character.
I will also add in some cards based on the times you play as Daxter in Jak 3.
I'm thinking of making an event that can only occur when playing as Daxter where you are supposed to run from the spider, not certain what the options will be.
