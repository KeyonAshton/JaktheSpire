# Combos

* Jump + Jump = Double Jump (3 extra block, +1 per upgraded jump)
* Punch + Jump = Uppercut (extra hit to targeted enemy)
* Roll + Punch = Uppercut (extra hit to targeted enemy)
* Jump + Punch =  Ground Slam (extra hit to targeted enemy)
* Uppercut + Punch = upgraded Ground Slam (extra hit to targeted enemy)

### Combos below here haven't been made

* Yellow gun out + Jump + Spin Kick + Fire* = Wastelander Spin* (1-2 hits for random enemies, no ammo needed)
* Yellow gun out + Punch + Fire* = Wastelander Punch*  (1-2 hits for targeted enemy, no ammo needed)

Cards with * don't exist. Might make some require combo, might not, depends on balancing.
I might also not need as many cards for the combos.

## Dark Eco Combos

Each of these will deplete Dark Eco
* Uppercut = Dark Blast* (multiple little hits to all enemies)
* Ground Slam = Dark Bomb (1 big hit to all enemies)
* Punch + Punch = Dark Strike* (1 really big hit on targeted enemy)

## Light Eco Combos

Each of these will decrease Light Eco by a substantial amount
* Roll + Punch = Flash Freeze* (stuns all the enemies for 1-3 turns, might just give you an extra turn or two, balancing will decide)
* Jump + Jump = Light Flight* (gives chance to evade attacks, more jumps = higher chance at decreasing gains, only lasts for that turn)
* ? = Light Regeneration* (either heals based on amount of light eco, or gives Regen based on amount, depletes Light Eco)
* Spin Kick = Light Shield* (replaces Spin Kick. gives intangible, but heavily drains light eco for each hit, gives thorns, also can't attack)
